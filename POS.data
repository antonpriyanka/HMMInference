long observation has taught mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; ;

some of the earliest recordings , made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track , whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts .

fearful of inviting a military showdown with the west which they could not win , the communists seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes , in mob uprisings in the streets , in parliaments , in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators , at the united nations , on the propaganda front , at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level .

i should like to underline four points i made in my first report with respect to vocational education .
ADJ CONJ ADV . ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB NOUN DET VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET VERB ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN .
first and foremost , vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation .
ADJ . ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP NOUN NUM CONJ NUM CONJ ADV VERB ADJ ADP PRT DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN . .
second , vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ; ;
ADV . ADP ADJ NOUN CONJ ADJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB PRT VERB ADV .
however , for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier .
ADJ . DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET VERB VERB ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN . .
third , the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; ;
PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP DET PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN . CONJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB VERB PRT ADP DET ADJ NOUN DET PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN .
they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers , and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time .
ADJ . DET NOUN ADP ADJ VERB NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN .
fourth , the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality .

this last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few , if any , graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training , the whole idea of relevance disappears .

vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school `` chore '' for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter .

those who , because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees , would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience .
